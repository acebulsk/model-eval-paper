<!-- **Abstract:** Validation of a revised canopy snow mass and energy balance at based on subcanopy SWE measurements at two needleleaf forests characterised by a cold-dry climate resulted in comparable absolute mean bias to an existing model. However, simulated subcanopy SWE at a temperate-coastal forest plot resulted in a major reduction in the simulated error compared to an existing model. The overestimation of subcanopy snow accumulation in the existing model was attributed to an underestimation of snow interception due to the maximum canopy snow load incorporated by the model in addition to the empirically derived ice-bulb temperature thresholds used to predict the transition from dry snow unloading to melt-induced unloading which never triggered the melt process and resulted in nearly all canopy snow reaching the ground as snow rather than drip. In contrast, the revised model—which does not compute initial interception as a function of canopy snow load and predicts canopy snowmelt using an energy balance-based approach—led to a greater fraction of snow intercepted in the canopy and also more canopy snow reaching the ground as drip. -->

# Introduction

Existing canopy snow models have shown variable transferability in their ability to simulate subcanopy snow accumulation across forests with differing meteorology and species [@Rutter2009; @Krinner2018]. However, new insights on canopy snow processes has been developed through recent studies by @Lundquist2021, @Lumbrazo2022, @Cebulski2025a, and @Cebulski2025b. @Lundquist2021 highlight that the increase in throughfall with antecedent snow load incorporated in most initial snow interception parameterisations over emphasises the amount of snow reaching the ground, if combined with a comprehensive canopy snow unloading routine. @Staines2023 and @Cebulski2025a built on this theory by @Lundquist2021 that initial interception is a function of canopy density alone. Moreover, @Roesch2001, @Ellis2010, @Floyd2012, and @Lumbrazo2022 show the importance of representing both wind and melt-induced unloading for representing canopy snow ablation. New observations by @Cebulski2025a support the theory that canopy snow processes can be more accurately represented without the concept of a maximum canopy snow load when calculating initial interception, which is included in the @Hedstrom1998 and @Andreadis2009 parameterisations. In addition, a new physically-based canopy snow mass and energy balance presented in @Cebulski2025b provided improved representation of canopy snow ablation compared to previous approaches that were either missing key processes (i.e., dry snow unloading in @Andreadis2009) or based on empirical relationships (i.e., ice-bulb temperature induced melt unloading and drip in @Ellis2010). These afforementioned advances in process representation have been incorporated as new parameterisations and implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform and are tested here in there accuracy in simulating subcanopy snow accumulation. 

Objective: To evaluate new snow interception and ablation parameterizations on their effectiveness in simulating the accumulation of subcanopy snow water equivalent and diagnosing causative processes in needleleaf forests.

Research Question: 

1. What is the performance of a novel hydrological model in simulating the accumulation of subcanopy snow water equivalent (SWE) in forested environments characterized by varying tree species, canopy structures, and meteorological conditions?
2. How does the performance of the new model in simulating SWE compare to that of a conventional modelling approach across differing environments?
3. What are the canopy snow processes that account for the differences in simulated SWE between the modelling approaches and how do these differ with climate and forest structural differences?

Evaluation of the new model in simulating canopy snow load has been addressed in @Cebulski2025a and @Cebulski2025b.

# Methods

## Study Sites

This study evaluates two model structures in simulating SWE in four forest plots:

  - Fortress Mountain Research Basin - Powerline Forest Site (50.83, -115.20, 2100 m asl.)  The subalpine forest at this elevation consists of coexisting S. fir and Engelmann spruce tree species. Species proportions are similar between both sites, with S. fir being the dominant species and Engelmann spruce making up the remainder (71.9% and 29.5%, respectively). [@Langs2020]
  - Marmot Creek Research Basin - Upper Forest (50.93, -115.16, 1848 m asl.) - Vegetation consisted primarily  of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. Latifolia) [@Fang2019]
  - Russell Creek Research Basin - Old Growth Upper Stephanie Site (50.32, -126.35, 700 m asl.) Abies amabilis (Amabilis fir) and Tsuga heterophylla (Western hemlock) [@Floyd2012]
  - Wolf Creek Research Basin - Wolf Creek Forest Site (60.60, -134.96, 750 m asl.) White Spruce and Lodgepole Pine (from veg survey unpublished)

## Simulation of Subcanopy Snowpack

The Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform (CRHM) was implemented to simulate snow water equivalent at each of the four forest plots. The CRHM platform is described in detail in @Pomeroy2022; and the up-to-date source code is available at https://github.com/srlabUsask/crhmcode. Hourly climate forcing data from station-based measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, total precipitation, and above canopy incoming solar radiation were used to run CRHM. A description of the sites and instrumentation relevant to the climate forcing measurements are provided in [@Rasouli2019; @Floyd2012; @Fang2019; @Cebulski2025a]. Incoming solar radiation observations were not available for Wolf Creek and were simulated following theoretical clear-sky radiation by @Garnier1970 and atmospheric transmittance by @Annandale2002 and @Shook2011. 

Atmospheric precipitation was partitioned into snow and/or rain phases following the psychometric energy balance approach of @Harder2013 which accounts for the influence of temperature and humidity on precipitation phase. The interaction of incoming precipitation with the forest canopy was treated using two different approaches. An updated approach following @Cebulski2025a and @Cebulski2025b (CP25) integrated new relationships for snow interception and ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy within CRHM. This new approach simulates initial interception of snow in the canopy as a function of canopy density (calculated as a function of canopy coverage and hydrometeor trajectory angle) and subsequent ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy by unloading (function of canopy snow load, canopy snowmelt rate, and wind shear stress), energy balance-based snowmelt, and energy balance-based sublimation [@Essery2003]. See @Cebulski2025b for a full description of the canopy snow mass and energy mass balance parameterisation. A second approach (E10) which is based on observations by @Hedstrom1998, @Pomeroy1998b, and @Floyd2012 and implemented and described in @Ellis2010. E10 calculates initial interception of snow in the canopy as a function of canopy density, antecedent snow load, and a species dependent storage capacity following @Hedstrom1998. Ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy is determined by dry snow unloading (function of canopy snow load), unloading due to melt (threshold function of ice-bulb temperature), canopy snowmelt drainage (threshold function of ice-bulb temperature), and sublimation by an analytical energy balance-based parameterisation [@Pomeroy1998b].

A two-layer energy and mass balance snowmelt model [Snobal, @Marks1998] was used to calculate subcanopy snowpack processes. Net shortwave radiation to the subcanopy snowpack was simulated by calculating the transmittance of irradiance through the canopy, less the amount reflected from the snow surface [@Pomeroy2009; @Ellis2010]. Incoming longwave radiation to subcanopy snow was simulated by thermal emissions from the atmosphere and vegetation elements, weighted by sky-view-factor [@Ellis2010; @Pomeroy2009]. Sensible and latent heat fluxes to the subcanopy snowpack were determined using an approach adopted from @Brutsaert1982 and @Marks1992 and is described in the CRHM source code. Only two water years were simulated at Russell due to limited model forcing and validation data.

## Model Evaluation

Simulated subcanopy SWE by the two model structures (E10 and CP25) was evaluated using snow survey observations collected from transects at the four forest plots. The performance of the two models was evaluated based on the differences in simulated ($S_i$) and observed ($O_i$) values of SWE using mean bias (MB) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as:

$$
\text{MB} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}(S_i-O_i)
$$ {#eq-mb}

and

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(S_i-O_i)^2}{n}}
$$ {#eq-rmse}

Values for $S_i$ were selected for each site from the E10 and CP25 CRHM simulated SWE state for the timestamp that matched each of the snow survey observations ($O_i$). The MB and RMSE statistics represent the model performance over all simulation years for each site.

# Results 

Amongst the sites and years included in the study, accumulation of snowfall below the canopy was less than cumulative snowfall observed in open clearings adjacent to each forest transect (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe). At peak seasonal subcanopy SWE, when averaged over all years Fortress had the highest fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at `r frac_sf_as_pk_swe_lst[["Fortress - Powerline Forest"]]`, followed by Marmot and Wolf Creek which both had similar fractions at `r frac_sf_as_pk_swe_lst[["Wolf Creek - Forest"]]`, and Russell had the smallest fraction at `r frac_sf_as_pk_swe_lst[["Russell - Old Growth"]]`. Variations in the prevalence of canopy snow unloading, melt/drip, and sublimation contributed to the observed differences in subcanopy snow accumulation relative to the open clearings at each site. At the temperate-maritime Russell site mid-winter melt events also contributed to these observed differences. Following validation of the new CP25 model in representing subcanopy SWE, a diagnosis on the contribution of each canopy snow processes in influencing subcanopy snowfall accumulation will be conducted in @sec-sf-partition for each site.

Note: snowfall was determined from observed total precipitation for each site using the snowfall fraction simulated in CRHM following @Harder2013.](figs/final/figure3_a.png){#fig-sf-subcpy-swe}

Observed subcanopy SWE varied from a seasonal mean of `r obs_swe_stats$min_mean_swe |> round(1)` to `r obs_swe_stats$max_mean_swe |> round(1)` kg m^-2^ (@fig-swe-ann-mean) and seasonal peak SWE varied from `r obs_swe_stats$min_peak_swe |> round(1)` to `r obs_swe_stats$max_peak_swe |> round(1)` kg m^-2^ (@fig-swe-ann-peak) across all sites and years.

![Bar chart comparing peak water year snow water equivalent between snow survey observations (OBS) and the two models (CP25 and E10).](figs/final/figure4.png){#fig-swe-ann-peak}

Over all years and sites, the CP25 model had a lower mean bias of `r cp25_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ compared to E10's mean bias of `r e10_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^  in representing the individual subcanopy SWE measurements shown in @fig-swe-ts (@tbl-swe-mb). Across the three colder climate sites (i.e., Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek) the mean bias for both models was lower at `r cp25_no_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ and `r e10_no_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ for CP25 and E10 respectively. The CP25 model tended to underestimate SWE at these three colder sites while E10 overestimated SWE (@tbl-swe-mb). CP25 had its smallest mean bias at Fortress of `r cp25_fm_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^—where the canopy snow energy and mass balance parameterisations were developed—followed by Marmot, Wolf Creek, and Russell. E10 had its lowest mean bias at Marmot—where this canopy snow model had previously been tested and developed—followed by Wolf Creek, Fortress, and Russell (@tbl-swe-mb). Both the CP25 and E10 models had relatively similar performance at Marmot and Wolf Creek based on their absolute mean biases which had absolute values which differed by less than 1 kg m^-2^ (@tbl-swe-mb). Although E10 had a marginally reduced mean bias at Wolf Creek of `r e10_wc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ compared to `r cp25_wc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ for CP25 the RMSE across all sites was lower for CP25 (@tbl-swe-mb). The lower RMSE for CP25 compared to E10 is also reflected in CP25's closer estimates to mean and peak seasonal SWE across all water years across all four sites compared to E10 (@fig-swe-ann-mean; @fig-swe-ann-peak). Three years contributed to the higher RMSE at Marmot where E10 simulated SWE was greatly overestimated based on a mean and peak value by over 50 kg m^-2^ (nearly 100% of observed SWE) for the water years 2011 and 2012 (@fig-swe-ann-mean; @fig-swe-ann-peak). In contrast, E10 had a very large underestimation in subcanopy SWE at Marmot for the water year 2019. At Wolf Creek, E10 also had deviations of ~30 kg m^-2^ (~100% greater than observed SWE) from observed mean and peak seasonal SWE for 2016 and 2017. Both models had their worst overall performance for the temperate-maritime Russell site; however, CP25 did show a substantial improvement compared to the E10 model with mean biases of `r cp25_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ and `r e10_rc_mb |> round(2)` kg m^-2^ respectively. Although the intent of this evaluation is to assess the performance of each model in simulating subcanopy SWE, uncertainties in model forcing and physical parameters (i.e., canopy coverage, LAI) may also contribute to systematic biases in the evaluation.

Seasonal subcanopy SWE accumulation and ablation was generally well represented by both models at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek (@fig-swe-ts). However, E10 failed to simulate the timing of SWE accumulation and ablation well for 2011, 2012, and 2019 at Marmot. The largest deviation in simulated seasonal SWE occurred at Russell for E10 where subcanopy snow accumulation was simulated at a much higher rate compared to the observed and CP25 over the two years that were simulated. At Wolf Creek CP25 had a delay in simulating the initial accumulation of subcanopy SWE for water years 2017, 2018, and 2019.

## Snowfall Partitioning {#sec-sf-partition}

A greater fraction of annual snowfall was sublimated by CP25 compared to E10 for all four sites across all years (@fig-frac-subl). Lower interception efficiency combined with higher average rates of unloading for the E10 model led to more snowfall being partitioned towards the ground compared to the CP25 model (@fig-frac-unld) leading to reduced sublimation of canopy snow and thus overprediction of subcanopy SWE accumulation (@tbl-swe-mb). The underprediction of subcanopy SWE by the CP25 model at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek (@tbl-swe-mb) may have been due to an overestimate of sublimation and/or canopy snowmelt rates leading to less snowfall being partitioned to the ground as solid snow. The difference in the annual fraction of snowfall that was sublimated between the CP25 and E10 models was most prevalent at Marmot (@fig-frac-subl). Factors that may contribute to this large deviation include the lower unloading rates observed for CP25 at this site (@fig-frac-unld) compared to E10 resulting from the lower wind speed and air temperatures at this site (@fig-met-normals), reducing the unloading and canopy snowmelt rates thus increasing the amount of canopy snow subject to sublimation for CP25. For E10, the April—June monthly air temperature normals at Marmot—months when this site receives most of its snowfall (@fig-met-normals)—are also largely within the E10 ice-bulb temperature unloading range (-3°C to 6°C) which are ideal conditions for initiating unloading due to warming for the E10 model. Relatively similar fractions of annual snowfall was sublimated by the two models at Fortress and Wolf Creek (@fig-frac-subl) due to the similar sublimation parameterisation used by the two models combined with the similar fraction of snow partitioned towards the ground (@fig-frac-unld). Although CP25 had higher drip/melt rates than E10, increased throughfall by E10 coupled with the constant unloading rate as a function of snow load likely made up for E10's lower melt/drip rate (@fig-frac-drip). Process observations of unloading, melt, and sublimation were not available and thus the simulations of snowfall partitioning could not be directly evaluated.

##  Simulated Canopy Snow Load

Over all years and sites, CP25 predicted consistently higher canopy snow loads compared to the E10 model (@fig-cpy-swe). This results from E10's increase in throughfall with increasing antecedent snow load as well as the constant unloading rate as a function of snow load and ice-bulb temperature and led to more snowfall partitioned to the ground as solid snow compared to CP25 (@fig-frac-unld). Some snowfall events had similar initial accumulation of snow in the canopy between the two models up until the E10 species snow load capacity was reached (see colder events in Jan and Feb at Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek in @fig-cpy-swe-select). Canopy snow load infrequently reached the CP25 maximum load of 50 kg m^-2^ at all four sites (@fig-cpy-swe). At Russell, while annual snowfall amounts were similar to Fortress (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe), increased canopy snow ablation rates due to warmer temperatures at Russell limited the accumulation of snow in the canopy in spring (@fig-cpy-swe; @fig-cpy-swe-select).

In addition to the large difference in canopy load simulated between CP25 and E10 across all four sites, the duration that the canopies of each site were simulated to have more than 2 kg m^-2^ of snow varied between the four sites and two models (@fig-frac-cpy-load-th). A threshold of 2 kg m^-2^ was selected based on observations by @Pomeroy1996 who found minimal influence of canopy snow load on above canopy albedo for loads less than 1.6 kg m^-2^. Across all four sites, canopy loads greater than 2 kg m^-2^ were observed to persist longer for CP25 compared to E10 (@fig-frac-cpy-load-th). At Fortress and Russell snow loads above this threshold persisted up to two times longer for CP25 compared to E10. The difference at Marmot and Wolf Creek between the two models were found to be less due to the lower snowfall of these sites which lowered event canopy snow loads thus yielding higher interception inefficiencies for the E10 model.

# Discussion

## Model Performance in Simulating Subcanopy Snow Accumulation 

New advances in process understanding of the canopy snow energy and mass balance by @Lundquist2021, @Lumbrazo2022, @Staines2023, @Cebulski2025a, and @Cebulski2025b were implemented in the CRHM platform and tested for their accuracy in simulating subcanopy snow accumulation. The theories presented in these studies including not needing to calculate throughfall as a function of canopy snowload when combined with a comprehensive canopy snow ablation routine [@Lundquist2021; @Cebulski2025a], incorporating both melt- and dry-snow unloading [@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012; @Roesch2001; @Lumbrazo2022; @Cebulski2025b], and using more physically-based routines instead of empirically driven approaches for calculating canopy snow melt and corresponding unloading [@Storck2002; @Andreadis2009; @Cebulski2025b] were supported based on the ability of these theories to better represent subcanopy snow accumulation compared to an existing approach in the four forest sites tested in this study characterised by humid-maritime to dry-continental climates. 

A new approach following recent advances in canopy snow process understanding resulted in reduced error in simulating subcanopy snow accumulation across all four sites. This new routine includes improved representations on the amount of snow stored in the canopy, processes that contribute to unloading, and thus the quantity and time that snow is intercepted in the canopy and exposed to higher rates of sublimation and/or melt. An existing model following the theories outlined by @Ellis2010 resulted in an overestimation of subcanopy SWE largely due to an overestimation of canopy snow unloading and throughfall which limited the accumulation of new snow in the canopy and thus the time snow was exposed to increased energy for sublimation and/or melt in the canopy. The ice-bulb temperature-based unloading threshold for E10 is between -3 and 6 °C which aligns with the mean monthly air temperature for Russell presented in @fig-met-normals resulting in the majority of canopy snow unloading as solid snow, as the high relative humidity of this site limits canopy snow sublimation. Moreover, the dense old growth canopy limits solar energy irradiance to the subcanopy snow which slows ablation of the subcanopy snowpack. The CP25 model better approximates subcanopy SWE however, the error for this site is still higher compared to the others. While several factors may contribute to error in the CP25 model including: uncertainties in the canopy snow energy balance model (e.g., simplifications in radiation transmittance through the canopy, longwave emission from the vegetation elements to the canopy snow, sensible and latent heat approximations) and mass balance parameterisations (e.g., fraction of snow contacting the canopy that is intercepted ($\alpha$ parameter in @Cebulski2025a), canopy snow unloading parameterisations). The frequent occurrence of air temperatures near the melting point for the warm-humid temperate maritime climate at Russell (@fig-met-normals) may increase the prevalence of uncertainties in the energy balance model for this site. Compared to the remaining three other colder sites which have less frequent temperature swings across the melting point when snow is intercepted in the canopy. Possible increases in cohesion of snowfall near the melting point [i.e., rime-ice accumulation @Lumbrazo2022] may also contribute to reduced dry-snow unloading rates thus reducing subcanopy snow accumulation through partitioning more snow into drip or sublimation processes, however more research is needed to confirm this.

Although Fortress and Marmot have relatively similar geographic location the mean bias of E10 at Fortress was much higher compared to its performance at Marmot and the CP25 performance at Fortress. Fortress receives more snowfall compared to Marmot which may contribute to the overestimation of subcanopy SWE by the E10 model as found in @Cebulski2025a where the theory underlying the E10 model that interception efficiency is a function of antecedent snow load was not found to apply in this forest. Thus as the canopy fills with snow at Fortress E10 intercepts less snow to the subcanopy while CP25 continues to intercept new snow in the canopy. Although E10 overestimated SWE on average, it also greatly underestimated SWE for some years. Underestimation by E10 can be attributed to lower snowfall years which would lead to lower unloading rates for the E10 snowload-dependent unloading rate, which would lead to snow intercepted in the canopy longer and subject to sublimation (i.e., 2019 for Marmot in @fig-swe-ann-mean; @fig-swe-ann-mean).

Both models performed best at the sites where they were developed (i.e, CP25 at Fortress and E10 at Marmot). CP25 was more transferable to sites other than where the model was developed based on the mean bias and RMSE compared to E10. Although the E10 model had suitable estimates of subcanopy SWE, this model simulated negligible canopy snow melt/drip. Depending on the cold content of the subcanopy snowpack liquid meltwater from snow intercepted in the canopy may refreeze in the snowpack or move through the snowpack as discharge. Therefore evaluation of canopy models on SWE alone is not be sufficient to capture the tramission of canopy SWE as drip directly through the subcanopy snowpack.

The lower snowfall rate at Wolf Creek and higher interception rate for CP25 compared to E10 led to throughfall and unloading rates that were smaller than the snowpack initiation threshold employed in Snobal. In contrast, E10 intercepted less snow and had higher unloading rates than CP25 leading to higher initial accumulation for these three years at Wolf Creek.

Forest lysimeters that separate SWE from subcanopy snowmelt drainage could help further evaluate process representation.

Although both models achieved similar performance in simulating subcanopy SWE at three out of four sites there is a large difference in the duration that canopy snow loads sufficient enough to impact above canopy albedo which would have important impacts on land surface model radiation budgets in cold-regions forests

Some existing issues with snobal causing some problems. The baseline model canopy fills with snow quicker and then unloads at a larger rate leading to larger initial accumulation of forest snow at wolf creek. Whereas the updated canosnobal model incrementally unloads continuously and the existing cansnobal module immediately melts out the incremental throughfall + unloaded snow.

## Influence of Climate on Snowfall Partitioning 

Although Russell received similar amounts of snowfall to Fortress (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe), Fortress was observed to have higher subcanopy snow accumulation primarily because 40% of annual snowfall was simulated by CP25 to melt in the canopy at Russell contributing a large fraction of liquid water below the canopy. Moreover, due to the low cold content of the maritime snowpack liquid water dripping onto the subcanopy snowpack was less likely to refreeze. This large fraction annual snowfall that melted in the canopy led to greatly reduced simulated subcanopy snow accumulation CP25 at Russell relative to the annual snowfall rates in this forest. Russell had very warm and humid conditions leading to considerable melt of intercepted snow which was not stored in the subcanopy snowpack but contributed water into the water balance with a smaller contribution of sublimation losses. In addition, the warmer temperatures at Russell (@fig-met-normals) also contributes to some melt of the snowpack throughout the year limiting accumulation (@fig-swe-ts). The high contribution of canopy snowmelt on snowfall paritiing led to the lowest fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at 0.3 (-) when observed at peak subcanopy SWE.

Higher snowfall rates at Fortress coupled with increased wind exposure led to increased unloading leading to less snow was subject to increased energy in the canopy resulting in a lower contribution of canopy snow sublimation (@fig-frac-subl). Although Fortress had the cold and dry conditions to promote significant sublimation losses—relatively similar to Marmot and Wolf Creek (@fig-met-normals), the increased unloading rates led to reduced snow available for canopy snow sublimation—nearly as low as the humid Russell site. The increased unloading and reduced contribution of canopy snow sublimation combined with the relatively low canopy snowmelt fraction (@fig-frac-melt) led to the highest fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at 0.6 (-) when observed at peak subcanopy SWE.

Cool dry conditions at Marmot and Wolf Creek coupled with lower snowfall amounts led to lower unloading rates and a larger contribution of sublimation limiting accumulation of snow to the subcanopy (@fig-frac-subl). Moreover, melt of intercepted snow played a smaller role due to the cooler temperatures. The lower unloading and throughfall fractions for both Marmot and Wolf Creek (@fig-frac-unld) combined with reduced contribution of canopy snow melt (@fig-frac-melt) led to the highest fraction of snowfall that sublimated in the canopy. However, despite the large atmospheric losses to canopy snow sublimation at these two sites the fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at peak subcanopy SWE was slightly higher than Russell due to the reduced contribution of canopy snow melt and mid-winter melt events at 0.4 (-) for both Marmot and Wolf Creek.

Despite Russell having the lowest fraction of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at peak SWE (@fig-sf-subcpy-swe), this site had the lowest fraction of snowfall lost via canopy snow sublimation (@fig-frac-subl). As a result, the influence of forest canopy on the net quantity of water reaching the soil was lowest at Russell compared to the other three sites. However, the increased energy fluxes to snow intercepted in the canopy led to increased canopy snowmelt most of this canopy snow meltwater was observed to drain directly through the snowpack and into the soil and thus providing a consistent source of liquid water into the soil year round. This is likely an advantage for tree species on Vancouver Island which typically continue growing year round and provides a constant source of water. Slow consistent sources of snowmelt water have also been shown to be more effective in recharging groundwater aquifers. In contrast, open clearings on Vancouver Island have reduced melt rates throughout the year resulting in a higher rate of snowmelt discharge in the spring. @Hayashi2019 and @Barnhart2016 discuss how slow and earlier snowmelt increases the opportunity time for infiltration, and groundwater recharge, and reduced ET losses later in spring and that most faster melt tends to runoff while slower melt rates recharge subsurface flows. However, many studies considering snowmelt timing are related to open clearings and further work is needed to investigate thee impacts on the timing of snowmelt in vegetated areas. This study did not investigate ET losses from the forest canopies. Reduced mid-winter canopy snow and subcanopy snow melt events in the colder Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek climates may result in a higher fraction of precipitation partitioned into runoff and less groundwater recharge. As more regions experience snow process and land cover changes better understanding how precipitation is partitioned is crucial for understanding the corresponding impacts on water resources.

## Influence of Tree Species on Snowfall Partitioning

The species of needleleaf forest that composes the canopy overlying each site also contributed to the observed differences in subcanopy SWE accumulation. While not the main focus of this study, differing species of needleleaf vegetation have differing elasticity of their branches, needle composition, and crown structure which impact both the interception and ablation of snow in the canopy. The Marmot and Wolf Creek sites both were primarily composed of spruce trees (@tbl-site-meta) coupled with the similar cool climate of these two sites (@fig-met-normals) may had led to the similar fractions of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack at both sites and similar fractions of canopy snow melt and sublimation here (@fig-frac-drip; @fig-frac-subl). In contrast, while the Fortress and Russell sites were both comprised of primarily fir trees (@tbl-site-meta) large differences in climate cold and dry at Fortress versus warm and humid at Russell (@fig-met-normals) combined with tree characteristics smaller trees at Fortress compared to Russell likely contributed to the different vegetation influences on canopy snow partitioning. The amount of seasonal snowfall stored in the subcanopy snowpack was nearly half of that for Russell than of Fortress, despite the canopy coverage of fortress only being 20% less. Factors that may have contributed to the increased snow storage at Fortress likely include the larger trees (~50 m) at Russell versus (~10 m) at Fortress which could have stored considerably more snow, coupled with the low wind speeds at Russell would have led to increased exposure of snow to the increased energy energy in the canopy compared to the subcanopy snowpack. The larger trees at Russell may have slower unloading rates resulting from larger more supportive branches. However, unloading rates depending on tree species or age remains a subject for future research. Cooler temperatures at fortress led to increased partitioning of seasonall snowfall into dry snow unloading compared to Russell. The contribution of tree species in influencing the different forest-snow partitioning between the three cold sites (Fortress, Marmot, and Wolf Creek) are largely overshadowed by the large difference in canopy cover (20% less at Fortress) coupled with increased wind exposure at Fortress which increased dry snow unloading. However, this does suggest that the differences in sub-needleleaf vegetation species is likely smaller than vegetation structure, density, and climate differences and supports earlier theories suggested by @Satterlund1970.

# Conclusions

Representation of the canopy snow energy and mass balance using a novel approach resulted in improved simulation of subcanopy snow accumulation in four forests with diverse climate and forest. This new physically based approach resulted in reduced error in simulating subcanopy SWE also allows for improved process diagnosis on the influence of vegetation on snow accumulation. This new canopy snow model includes interception of snow on the canopy as a function of canopy density and hydrometeor trajectory angle. Ablation of canopy snow occurs through unloading (function of wind speed, canopy snow melt, and canopy snow load), melt/drip, and sublimation. In contrast, an existing model which estimates throughfall and unloading as a function of antecedent snow load overestimated the amount of snow reaching the ground. Moreover, this existing model greatly underestimated the fraction of snowfall intercepted in the canopy that was partitioned into liquid meltwater. Melt of snow intercepted in the canopy was better represented by an energy balance-based approach resulting in drastically improved performance in subcanopy snow accumulation in a site with a coastal-maritime climate.

Although the new and old methods had relatively similar performance for the three colder climate sites a large difference in the fraction of snowfall partitioned as snow or drip to the ground or sublimation to the atmosphere was observed.

The role of vegetation in partitioning snowfall was found to be quite variable across differing climate and forests. Process diagnosis conducted using a novel canopy snow model helped improve understanding of the individual canopy snow processes that contribute to the observed differences in how snow is partitioned between the atmosphere, canopy, and ground. The greatest impact of vegetation of subcanopy snow accumulation was observed at the temperature-maritime Russell site where increased energy input into snow intercepted in the canopy led to ~40% of seasonal snow melting in the canopy providing a consistent source of liquid water into the water balance over winter. The cooler climates of Wolf Creek and Marmot, coupled with lower annual snowfall rates led to low unloading rates leading to up to half of seasonal snowfall being returned to the atmosphere via intercepted snow sublimation. High snowfall rates coupled with increased winds led to increased unloading rates at Fortress and a relatively lower contribution of intercepted snow sublimation compared to the other two cold climate sites. The influence of climate and canopy density on seasonal snowfall partitioning by needleleaf vegetation was found to be larger compared to inter species differences when considering primarily fir and spruce trees. Further work is require to investigate the influence of other tree species which may exhibit larger sensitivities such as cedar, hemlock, and deciduous as well as differing tree ages and sizes. 

The evaluation of the new canopy snow model would benefit from additional process-based measurements of initial canopy snow interception and subsequent ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy. Although satisfactory simulations of subcanopy snow accumulation were found at three sites for two models there is a large difference in the fraction of snow returned to the atmosphere and further work should focus on evaluating this partitioning to ensure atmospheric inputs of precipitation to cold-regions forests are accurately partitioned. Canopy snow mass and energy blance processes are rarely measured at hydrometerological stations but could help close this research gap.

Although two snowfall parameterisations were shown to have relatively similar performance in simulating subcanopy SWE the fraction of snow returned to the atmosphere was shown to differ substantially as a result of differing unloading and drip/melt rates.
